# Covid-19 Analysis 

This analysis was inspired by a quick guided project course I completed on Coursera in October 2020. Please feel free to access the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid19-data-analysis-using-python). The extension to India is more complex and utilises both national and state-level data. The project is curently in the cleaning stage and will have visuals and analysis in place by the end of 2020.
